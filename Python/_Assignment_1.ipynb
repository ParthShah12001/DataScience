    "<b>Ans </b>:- According to the python rules we cannot use numeric value as a variable name or a variable name cannot start with numeric value. Similarly we cannot used predefined key words to of python language as variables. Mainly because if we use anything like that as variable name it would create a confusion for which is the variable and which one is the numeric value of predefined key word and it would me impossible to write a proper code if we don't follow proper standards"
